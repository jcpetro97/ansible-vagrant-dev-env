# Below is an example of how to add a "role" to the requirements.yml file
# If you are using it from the commandline, roles can be downloaded using the following galaxy command
# ansible-galaxy install --force -r ./roles/requirements.yml   
# NOTE:  --force will overwrite anr roles that is already in the roles directory
